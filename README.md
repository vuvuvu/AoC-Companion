# AoC Companion

An AI-powered assistant designed to guide you through **Advent of Code** challenges without spoiling the fun. It adapts to your skill level and preferred programming language, acting as a pair programmer who nudges you in the right direction rather than handing you the answer.

## Features

- **🚫 No Spoilers Policy**: The AI is strictly instructed to provide guidance, logic, and pseudocode, but *never* the final solution or complete working code (unless specifically debugging your snippet).
- **🧠 Adaptive Hint Levels**:
  - **Vague Hint**: A gentle nudge about edge cases or the general idea.
  - **Logic/Algorithm**: High-level discussion of data structures (BFS, DFS, Maps, etc.).
  - **Pseudocode**: Step-by-step logic without language-specific syntax.
  - **Debugging**: Paste your code, and the AI will help find bugs.
- **🌍 Context Aware**:
  - Automatically fetches puzzle details from the official AoC website using Google Search grounding.
  - Configurable for any Year (2015-2025) and Day (1-25).
  - Supports multiple languages (Python, Rust, Go, JS, etc.).
- **📊 Visualizations**: Automatically renders **Mermaid.js** charts to explain complex algorithms or data structures visually.
- **💻 Hacker UI**: A terminal-inspired dark mode interface for that late-night coding vibe.

## Functions

- **Control Panel**: Sidebar configuration to set the specific puzzle context and desired help level.
- **Auto-Fetch**: Automatically attempts to retrieve the problem description via AI web search.
- **Manual Refresh**: Button to re-fetch puzzle context if the initial load fails.
- **Mermaid Rendering**: Real-time rendering of flowcharts and diagrams generated by the AI.
- **Session Management**: Reset chat history or update your API key directly from the UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via `@google/genai` SDK
- **Rendering**: `react-markdown`, `mermaid`
